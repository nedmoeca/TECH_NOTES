## Active Directory Overview
### Why Active Directory?

Active Directory (AD) is a directory service for Windows network environments. It is a distributed, hierarchical structure that allows for centralized management of an organization's resources, including users, computers, groups, network devices, file shares, group policies, devices, and trusts. AD provides authentication and authorization functions within a Windows domain environment. It has come under increasing attack in recent years. It is designed to be backward-compatible, and many features are arguably not "secure by default," and it can be easily misconfigured. This weakness can be leveraged to move laterally and vertically within a network and gain unauthorized access. AD is essentially a sizeable read-only database accessible to all users within the domain, regardless of their privilege level. A basic AD user account with no added privileges can enumerate most objects within AD. This fact makes it extremely important to properly secure an AD implementation because ANY user account, regardless of their privilege level, can be used to enumerate the domain and hunt for misconfigurations and flaws thoroughly. Also, multiple attacks can be performed with only a standard domain user account, showing the importance of a defense-in-depth strategy and careful planning focusing on security and hardening AD, network segmentation, and least privilege. One example is the [noPac](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/nopac-a-tale-of-two-vulnerabilities-that-could-end-in-ransomware) attack that was first released in December of 2021.

Active Directory makes information easy to find and use for administrators and users. AD is highly scalable, supports millions of objects per domain, and allows the creation of additional domains as an organization grows.

It is estimated that around 95% of [Fortune 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500) companies run Active Directory, making AD a key focus for attackers. A successful attack such as a phish that lands an attacker within the AD environment as a standard domain user would give them enough access to begin mapping out the domain and looking for avenues of attack. As security professionals, we will encounter AD environments of all sizes throughout our careers. It is essential to understand the structure and function of AD to become better informed as both an attacker and a defender.

Ransomware operators have been increasingly targeting Active Directory as a key part of their attack paths. The [Conti Ransomware](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/AA21-265A-Conti_Ransomware_TLP_WHITE.pdf) which has been used in more than 400 attacks around the world has been shown to leverage recent critical Active Directory flaws such as [PrintNightmare (CVE-2021-34527)](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527) and [Zerologon (CVE-2020-1472)](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2020-1472) to escalate privileges and move laterally in a target network. Understanding the structure and function of Active Directory is the first step in a career path to find and prevent these types of flaws before attackers do. Researchers are continually finding new, extremely high-risk attacks that affect Active Directory environments that often require no more than a standard domain user to obtain complete administrative control over the entire domain. There are many great open-source tools for penetration testers to enumerate and attack Active Directory. Still, to use these most effectively, we must understand how Active Directory works to identify obvious and nuanced flaws. Tools are only as effective as their operator is knowledgeable. So let's take the time to understand the structure and function of Active Directory before moving into later modules that will focus on in-depth manual and tool-based enumeration, attacks, lateral movement, post-exploitation, and persistence.

This module will lay the foundations for starting down the path of enumerating and attacking Active Directory. We will cover, in-depth, the structure and function of AD, discuss the various AD objects, discuss user rights and privileges, tools, and processes for managing AD, and even walk through examples of setting up a small AD environment.

#### History of Active Directory

LDAP, the foundation of Active Directory, was first introduced in [RFCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments) as early as 1971. Active Directory was predated by the [X.500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.500) organizational unit concept, which was the earliest version of all directory systems created by Novell and Lotus and released in 1993 as [Novell Directory Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetIQ_eDirectory).

Active Directory was first introduced in the mid-'90s but did not become part of the Windows operating system until the release of Windows Server 2000. Microsoft first attempted to provide directory services in 1990 with the release of Windows NT 3.0. This operating system combined features of the [LAN Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN_Manager) protocol and the [OS/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2) operating systems, which Microsoft created initially along with IBM lead by [Ed Iacobucci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Iacobucci) who also led the design of [IBM DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_DOS) and later co-founded Citrix Systems. The NT operating system evolved throughout the 90s, adapting protocols such as LDAP and Kerberos with Microsoft's proprietary elements. The first beta release of Active Directory was in 1997.

The release of Windows Server 2003 saw extended functionality and improved administration and added the `Forest` feature, which allows sysadmins to create "containers" of separate domains, users, computers, and other objects all under the same umbrella. [Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Directory_Federation_Services) was introduced in Server 2008 to provide Single Sign-On (SSO) to systems and applications for users on Windows Server operating systems. ADFS made it simpler and more streamlined for users to sign into applications and systems, not on their same LAN.

ADFS enables users to access applications across organizational boundaries using a single set of credentials. ADFS uses the [claims-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claims-based_identity) Access Control Authorization model, which attempts to ensure security across applications by identifying users by a set of claims related to their identity, which are packaged into a security token by the identity provider.

The release of Server 2016 brought even more changes to Active Directory, such as the ability to migrate AD environments to the cloud and additional security enhancements such as user access monitoring and [Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/service-accounts-group-managed). gMSA offers a more secure way to run specific automated tasks, applications, and services and is often a recommended mitigation against the infamous Kerberoasting attack.

2016 saw a more significant push towards the cloud with the release of Azure AD Connect, which was designed as a single sign-on method for users being migrated to the Microsoft Office 365 environment.

Active Directory has suffered from various misconfigurations from 2000 to the present day. New vulnerabilities are discovered regularly that affect Active Directory and other technologies that interface with AD, such as Microsoft Exchange. As security researchers continue to uncover new flaws, organizations that run Active Directory need to remain on top of patching and implementing fixes. As penetration testers, we are tasked with finding these flaws for our clients before attackers.

For this reason, we must have a solid foundation in Active Directory fundamentals and understand its structure, function, the various protocols that it uses to operate, how user rights and privileges are managed, how sysadmins administer AD and the multitude of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that can be present in an AD environment. Managing AD is no easy task. One change/fix can introduce additional issues elsewhere. Before beginning to enumerate and then attack Active Directory, let's cover foundational concepts that will follow us throughout our infosec careers.

As said before, 95% of Fortune 500 companies run Active Directory, and Microsoft has a near-complete monopoly in the directory services space. Even though many companies are transitioning to cloud and hybrid environments, on-prem AD is not going away for many companies. If you are performing network penetration testing engagements, you can be nearly sure to encounter AD in some way on almost all of them.

This fundamental knowledge will make us better attackers and give us insight into AD that will be extremely useful when providing remediation advice to our clients. A deep understanding of AD will make peeling back the layers less daunting, and we will have the same confidence when approaching an environment with 10,000 hosts as we do with one with 20.

### Active Directory Research Over the Years

Active Directory has been a major area of focus for security researchers for the past decade or so. Starting in 2014, we began to see many of the tools and much of the research emerge, leading to the discovery of common attacks and techniques that are still used today. Below is a timeline of events highlighting the discovery of some of the most impactful attacks and flaws by incredible researchers, as well as the release of some of the most widely used tools by penetration testers until this day. While many techniques have been discovered over the years, AD (and now Azure AD) presents a vast attack surface, and new attacks are still being discovered. New tools emerge that both penetration testers and defenders must have a firm grasp of to assist organizations with the difficult but critical task of securing AD environments.

As we can see from the timeline below, critical flaws are continuously being discovered. The noPac attack was discovered in December of 2021 and is the most recent critical AD attack that has been discovered at the time of writing (January of 2022). As we continue into 2022, we will surely see new tools and attacks released and new methods for exploiting and chaining together known vulnerabilities. We must stay on top of the latest and greatest Active Directory research to best help customers secure it or secure it ourselves.

This is by no means a comprehensive list of all the excellent research and tools that have been released over the years, but this is a snapshot of many of the most consequential ones seen over the past decade. The hard work of the researchers listed in this timeline (and many others) has led to remarkable discoveries and the creation of tools that can help both penetration testers and defenders dig deep into Active Directory environments. With them, it's easier to find both obvious and obscure, high-risk flaws before attackers do.

#### AD Attacks & Tools Timeline

##### 2021

The [PrintNightmare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PrintNightmare) vulnerability was released. This was a remote code execution flaw in the Windows Print Spooler that could be used to take over hosts in an AD environment. The [Shadow Credentials](https://posts.specterops.io/shadow-credentials-abusing-key-trust-account-mapping-for-takeover-8ee1a53566ab) attack was released which allows for low privileged users to impersonate other users and computer accounts if conditions are right, and can be used to escalate privileges in a domain. The [noPac](https://www.secureworks.com/blog/nopac-a-tale-of-two-vulnerabilities-that-could-end-in-ransomware) attack was released in mid-December of 2021 when much of the security world was focused on the Log4j vulnerabilities. This attack allows an attacker to gain full control over a domain from a standard domain user account if the right conditions exist.

##### 2020

The [ZeroLogon](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/exploits-and-vulnerabilities/2021/01/the-story-of-zerologon/) attack debuted late in 2020. This was a critical flaw that allowed an attacker to impersonate any unpatched domain controller in a network.

##### 2019

harmj0y delivered the talk ["Kerberoasting Revisited"](https://www.slideshare.net/harmj0y/derbycon-2019-kerberoasting-revisited) at DerbyCon which laid out new approaches to Kerberoasting. Elad Shamir released a [blog post](https://shenaniganslabs.io/2019/01/28/Wagging-the-Dog.html) outlining techniques for abusing resource-based constrained delegation (RBCD) in Active Directory. The company BC Security released [Empire 3.0](https://github.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire) (now version 4) which was a re-release of the PowerShell Empire framework written in Python3 with many additions and changes.

##### 2018

The "Printer Bug" bug was discovered by Lee Christensen and the [SpoolSample](https://github.com/leechristensen/SpoolSample) PoC tool was released which leverages this bug to coerce Windows hosts to authenticate to other machines via the MS-RPRN RPC interface. harmj0y released the [Rubeus toolkit](https://blog.harmj0y.net/redteaming/from-kekeo-to-rubeus/) for attacking Kerberos. Late in 2018 harmj0y also released the blog ["Not A Security Boundary: Breaking Forest Trusts"](https://blog.harmj0y.net/redteaming/not-a-security-boundary-breaking-forest-trusts/) which presented key research on performing attacks across forest trusts. The [DCShadow](https://www.dcshadow.com/) attack technique was also released by Vincent LE TOUX and Benjamin Delpy at the Bluehat IL 2018 conference. The [Ping Castle](https://github.com/vletoux/pingcastle/commits/master?after=f128d84e86e675f1ad65c4b9b05bd529e1f9dc7c+34&branch=master) tool was released by Vincent LE TOUX for performing security audits of Active Directory by looking for misconfigurations and other flaws that can raise the risk level of a domain and producing a report that can be used to identify ways to further harden the environment.

##### 2017

The [ASREPRoast](https://blog.harmj0y.net/activedirectory/roasting-as-reps/) technique was introduced for attacking user accounts that don't require Kerberos preauthentication. _wald0 and harmj0y delivered the pivotal talk on Active Directory ACL attacks ["ACE Up the Sleeve"](https://www.slideshare.net/harmj0y/ace-up-the-sleeve) at Black Hat and DEF CON. harmj0y released his ["A Guide to Attacking Domain Trusts"](https://blog.harmj0y.net/redteaming/a-guide-to-attacking-domain-trusts/) blog post on enumerating and attacking domain trusts.

##### 2016

[BloodHound](https://wald0.com/?p=68) was released as a game changing tool for visualizing attack paths in AD at [DEF CON 24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP8ZCczC1OU).

##### 2015

2015 saw the release of some of the most impactful Active Directory tools of all time. The [PowerShell Empire framework](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire) was released. [PowerView 2.0](https://blog.harmj0y.net/redteaming/powerview-2-0/) released as part of the (now deprecated) [PowerTools](https://github.com/PowerShellEmpire/PowerTools/) repository, which was a part of the PowerShellEmpire GitHub account. The DCSync attack was first released by Benjamin Delpy and Vincent Le Toux as part of the [mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/) tool. It has since been included in other tools. The first stable release of CrackMapExec ([(v1.0.0)](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec/releases?page=3) was introduced. Sean Metcalf gave a talk at Black Hat USA about the dangers of Kerberos Unconstrained Delegation and released an excellent [blog post](https://adsecurity.org/?p=1667) on the topic. The [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/releases?page=2) toolkit was also released in 2015. This is a collection of Python tools, many of which can be used to perform Active Directory attacks. It is still actively maintained as of January 2022 and is a key part of most every penetration tester's toolkit.

##### 2014

Veil-PowerView first [released](https://github.com/darkoperator/Veil-PowerView/commit/fdfd47c0a1e06e529bf31c93da7caed3479d08e1#diff-1695122ff2b5844b625f6d05c9274ce0a8b75b9b7cde84386df07e24ae98181b). This project later became part of the [PowerSploit](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit) framework as the (no longer supported) [PowerView.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1) AD recon tool. The Kerberoasting attack was first presented at a conference by [Tim Medin](https://twitter.com/timmedin) at SANS Hackfest 2014.

##### 2013

The [Responder](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Responder/commits/master?after=c02c74853298ea52a2bfaa4d250c3898886a44ac+174&branch=master) tool was released by Laurent Gaffie. Responder is a tool used for poisoning LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS on an Active Directory network. It can be used to obtain password hashes and also perform SMB Relay attacks (when combined with other tools) to move laterally and vertically in an AD environment. It has evolved considerably over the years and is still actively supported (with new features added) as of January 2022.

## Active Directory Fundamentals
### Active Directory Structure 

[Active Directory (AD)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/active-directory-domain-services-overview) is a directory service for Windows network environments. It is a distributed, hierarchical structure that allows for centralized management of an organization's resources, including users, computers, groups, network devices and file shares, group policies, servers and workstations, and trusts. AD provides authentication and authorization functions within a Windows domain environment. A directory service, such as [Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/active-directory-domain-services-overview) gives an organization ways to store directory data and make it available to both standard users and administrators on the same network. AD DS stores information such as usernames and passwords and manages the rights needed for authorized users to access this information. It was first shipped with Windows Server 2000; it has come under increasing attack in recent years. It is designed to be backward-compatible, and many features are arguably not "secure by default." It is difficult to manage properly, especially in large environments where it can be easily misconfigured.

Active Directory flaws and misconfigurations can often be used to obtain a foothold (internal access), move laterally and vertically within a network, and gain unauthorized access to protected resources such as databases, file shares, source code, and more. AD is essentially a large database accessible to all users within the domain, regardless of their privilege level. A basic AD user account with no added privileges can be used to enumerate the majority of objects contained within AD, including but not limited to:

|                          |                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Domain Computers         | Domain Users                |
| Domain Group Information | Organizational Units (OUs)  |
| Default Domain Policy    | Functional Domain Levels    |
| Password Policy          | Group Policy Objects (GPOs) |
| Domain Trusts            | Access Control Lists (ACLs) |

For this reason, we must understand how Active Directory is set up and the basics of administration before attempting to attack it. It's always easier to "break" things if we already know how to build them.

Active Directory is arranged in a hierarchical tree structure, with a forest at the top containing one or more domains, which can themselves have nested subdomains. A forest is the security boundary within which all objects are under administrative control. A forest may contain multiple domains, and a domain may include further child or sub-domains. A domain is a structure within which contained objects (users, computers, and groups) are accessible. It has many built-in Organizational Units (OUs), such as `Domain Controllers`, `Users`, `Computers`, and new OUs can be created as required. OUs may contain objects and sub-OUs, allowing for the assignment of different group policies.

At a very (simplistic) high level, an AD structure may look as follows:

```
INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/
├── ADMIN.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
│   ├── GPOs
│   └── OU
│       └── EMPLOYEES
│           ├── COMPUTERS
│           │   └── FILE01
│           ├── GROUPS
│           │   └── HQ Staff
│           └── USERS
│               └── barbara.jones
├── CORP.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
└── DEV.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
```

Here we could say that `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` is the root domain and contains the subdomains (either child or tree root domains) `ADMIN.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`, `CORP.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`, and `DEV.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` as well as the other objects that make up a domain such as users, groups, computers, and more as we will see in detail below. It is common to see multiple domains (or forests) linked together via trust relationships in organizations that perform a lot of acquisitions. It is often quicker and easier to create a trust relationship with another domain/forest than recreate all new users in the current domain. As we will see in later modules, domain trusts can introduce a slew of security issues if not appropriately administered.

![Diagram of Forest A and Forest B. Forest A: Parent Domain with three OUs, Child Domain with three OUs. Forest B: Domain with three OUs.](https://cdn.services-k8s.prod.aws.htb.systems/content/modules/74/ad_forests.png)

The graphic below shows two forests, `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` and `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL`. The two-way arrow represents a bidirectional trust between the two forests, meaning that users in `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` can access resources in `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL` and vice versa. We can also see multiple child domains under each root domain. In this example, we can see that the root domain trusts each of the child domains, but the child domains in forest A do not necessarily have trusts established with the child domains in forest B. This means that a user that is part of `admin.dev.freightlogistics.local` would NOT be able to authenticate to machines in the `wh.corp.inlanefreight.local` domain by default even though a bidirectional trust exists between the top-level `inlanefreight.local` and `freightlogistics.local` domains. To allow direct communication from `admin.dev.freightlogistics.local` and `wh.corp.inlanefreight.local`, another trust would need to be set up.

### Active Directory Terminology 

Before we go any further, let's take a step back and define some key terminology that will be used throughout this module and in general when dealing with Active Directory in any capacity.

Object
An object can be defined as ANY resource present within an Active Directory environment such as OUs, printers, users, domain controllers, etc.

Attributes
Every object in Active Directory has an associated set of attributes used to define characteristics of the given object. A computer object contains attributes such as the hostname and DNS name. All attributes in AD have an associated LDAP name that can be used when performing LDAP queries, such as displayName for Full Name and given name for First Name.

Schema
The Active Directory schema is essentially the blueprint of any enterprise environment. It defines what types of objects can exist in the AD database and their associated attributes. It lists definitions corresponding to AD objects and holds information about each object. For example, users in AD belong to the class "user," and computer objects to "computer," and so on. Each object has its own information (some required to be set and others optional) that are stored in Attributes. When an object is created from a class, this is called instantiation, and an object created from a specific class is called an instance of that class. For example, if we take the computer RDS01. This computer object is an instance of the "computer" class in Active Directory.

Domain
A domain is a logical group of objects such as computers, users, OUs, groups, etc. We can think of each domain as a different city within a state or country. Domains can operate entirely independently of one another or be connected via trust relationships.

Forest
A forest is a collection of Active Directory domains. It is the topmost container and contains all of the AD objects introduced below, including but not limited to domains, users, groups, computers, and Group Policy objects. A forest can contain one or multiple domains and be thought of as a state in the US or a country within the EU. Each forest operates independently but may have various trust relationships with other forests.

Tree
A tree is a collection of Active Directory domains that begins at a single root domain. A forest is a collection of AD trees. Each domain in a tree shares a boundary with the other domains. A parent-child trust relationship is formed when a domain is added under another domain in a tree. Two trees in the same forest cannot share a name (namespace). Let's say we have two trees in an AD forest: inlanefreight.local and ilfreight.local. A child domain of the first would be corp.inlanefreight.local while a child domain of the second could be corp.ilfreight.local. All domains in a tree share a standard Global Catalog which contains all information about objects that belong to the tree.

Container
Container objects hold other objects and have a defined place in the directory subtree hierarchy.

Leaf
Leaf objects do not contain other objects and are found at the end of the subtree hierarchy.

Global Unique Identifier (GUID)
A GUID is a unique 128-bit value assigned when a domain user or group is created. This GUID value is unique across the enterprise, similar to a MAC address. Every single object created by Active Directory is assigned a GUID, not only user and group objects. The GUID is stored in the ObjectGUID attribute. When querying for an AD object (such as a user, group, computer, domain, domain controller, etc.), we can query for its objectGUID value using PowerShell or search for it by specifying its distinguished name, GUID, SID, or SAM account name. GUIDs are used by AD to identify objects internally. Searching in Active Directory by GUID value is probably the most accurate and reliable way to find the exact object you are looking for, especially if the global catalog may contain similar matches for an object name. Specifying the ObjectGUID value when performing AD enumeration will ensure that we get the most accurate results pertaining to the object we are searching for information about. The ObjectGUID property never changes and is associated with the object for as long as that object exists in the domain.

Security principals
Security principals are anything that the operating system can authenticate, including users, computer accounts, or even threads/processes that run in the context of a user or computer account (i.e., an application such as Tomcat running in the context of a service account within the domain). In AD, security principals are domain objects that can manage access to other resources within the domain. We can also have local user accounts and security groups used to control access to resources on only that specific computer. These are not managed by AD but rather by the Security Accounts Manager (SAM).

Security Identifier (SID)
A security identifier, or SID is used as a unique identifier for a security principal or security group. Every account, group, or process has its own unique SID, which, in an AD environment, is issued by the domain controller and stored in a secure database. A SID can only be used once. Even if the security principal is deleted, it can never be used again in that environment to identify another user or group. When a user logs in, the system creates an access token for them which contains the user's SID, the rights they have been granted, and the SIDs for any groups that the user is a member of. This token is used to check rights whenever the user performs an action on the computer. There are also well-known SIDs that are used to identify generic users and groups. These are the same across all operating systems. An example is the Everyone group.

Distinguished Name (DN)
A Distinguished Name (DN) describes the full path to an object in AD (such as cn=bjones, ou=IT, ou=Employees, dc=inlanefreight, dc=local). In this example, the user bjones works in the IT department of the company Inlanefreight, and his account is created in an Organizational Unit (OU) that holds accounts for company employees. The Common Name (CN) bjones is just one way the user object could be searched for or accessed within the domain.

Relative Distinguished Name (RDN)
A Relative Distinguished Name (RDN) is a single component of the Distinguished Name that identifies the object as unique from other objects at the current level in the naming hierarchy. In our example, bjones is the Relative Distinguished Name of the object. AD does not allow two objects with the same name under the same parent container, but there can be two objects with the same RDNs that are still unique in the domain because they have different DNs. For example, the object cn=bjones,dc=dev,dc=inlanefreight,dc=local would be recognized as different from cn=bjones,dc=inlanefreight,dc=local.

sAMAccountName
The sAMAccountName is the user's logon name. Here it would just be bjones. It must be a unique value and 20 or fewer characters.

userPrincipalName
The userPrincipalName attribute is another way to identify users in AD. This attribute consists of a prefix (the user account name) and a suffix (the domain name) in the format of bjones@inlanefreight.local. This attribute is not mandatory.

FSMO Roles
In the early days of AD, if you had multiple DCs in an environment, they would fight over which DC gets to make changes, and sometimes changes would not be made properly. Microsoft then implemented "last writer wins," which could introduce its own problems if the last change breaks things. They then introduced a model in which a single "master" DC could apply changes to the domain while the others merely fulfilled authentication requests. This was a flawed design because if the master DC went down, no changes could be made to the environment until it was restored. To resolve this single point of failure model, Microsoft separated the various responsibilities that a DC can have into Flexible Single Master Operation (FSMO) roles. These give Domain Controllers (DC) the ability to continue authenticating users and granting permissions without interruption (authorization and authentication). There are five FSMO roles: Schema Master and Domain Naming Master (one of each per forest), Relative ID (RID) Master (one per domain), Primary Domain Controller (PDC) Emulator (one per domain), and Infrastructure Master (one per domain). All five roles are assigned to the first DC in the forest root domain in a new AD forest. Each time a new domain is added to a forest, only the RID Master, PDC Emulator, and Infrastructure Master roles are assigned to the new domain. FSMO roles are typically set when domain controllers are created, but sysadmins can transfer these roles if needed. These roles help replication in AD to run smoothly and ensure that critical services are operating correctly. We will walk through each of these roles in detail later in this section.

Global Catalog
A global catalog (GC) is a domain controller that stores copies of ALL objects in an Active Directory forest. The GC stores a full copy of all objects in the current domain and a partial copy of objects that belong to other domains in the forest. Standard domain controllers hold a complete replica of objects belonging to its domain but not those of different domains in the forest. The GC allows both users and applications to find information about any objects in ANY domain in the forest. GC is a feature that is enabled on a domain controller and performs the following functions:

Authentication (provided authorization for all groups that a user account belongs to, which is included when an access token is generated)
Object search (making the directory structure within a forest transparent, allowing a search to be carried out across all domains in a forest by providing just one attribute about an object.)
Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC)
A Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC) has a read-only Active Directory database. No AD account passwords are cached on an RODC (other than the RODC computer account & RODC KRBTGT passwords.) No changes are pushed out via an RODC's AD database, SYSVOL, or DNS. RODCs also include a read-only DNS server, allow for administrator role separation, reduce replication traffic in the environment, and prevent SYSVOL modifications from being replicated to other DCs.

Replication
Replication happens in AD when AD objects are updated and transferred from one Domain Controller to another. Whenever a DC is added, connection objects are created to manage replication between them. These connections are made by the Knowledge Consistency Checker (KCC) service, which is present on all DCs. Replication ensures that changes are synchronized with all other DCs in a forest, helping to create a backup in case one domain controller fails.

Service Principal Name (SPN)
A Service Principal Name (SPN) uniquely identifies a service instance. They are used by Kerberos authentication to associate an instance of a service with a logon account, allowing a client application to request the service to authenticate an account without needing to know the account name.

Group Policy Object (GPO)
Group Policy Objects (GPOs) are virtual collections of policy settings. Each GPO has a unique GUID. A GPO can contain local file system settings or Active Directory settings. GPO settings can be applied to both user and computer objects. They can be applied to all users and computers within the domain or defined more granularly at the OU level.

Access Control List (ACL)
An Access Control List (ACL) is the ordered collection of Access Control Entries (ACEs) that apply to an object.

Access Control Entries (ACEs)
Each Access Control Entry (ACE) in an ACL identifies a trustee (user account, group account, or logon session) and lists the access rights that are allowed, denied, or audited for the given trustee.

Discretionary Access Control List (DACL)
DACLs define which security principals are granted or denied access to an object; it contains a list of ACEs. When a process tries to access a securable object, the system checks the ACEs in the object's DACL to determine whether or not to grant access. If an object does NOT have a DACL, then the system will grant full access to everyone, but if the DACL has no ACE entries, the system will deny all access attempts. ACEs in the DACL are checked in sequence until a match is found that allows the requested rights or until access is denied.

System Access Control Lists (SACL)
Allows for administrators to log access attempts that are made to secured objects. ACEs specify the types of access attempts that cause the system to generate a record in the security event log.

Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
An FQDN is the complete name for a specific computer or host. It is written with the hostname and domain name in the format host name.domain name.tld. This is used to specify an object's location in the tree hierarchy of DNS. The FQDN can be used to locate hosts in an Active Directory without knowing the IP address, much like when browsing to a website such as google.com instead of typing in the associated IP address. An example would be the host DC01 in the domain INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL. The FQDN here would be DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL.

Tombstone
A tombstone is a container object in AD that holds deleted AD objects. When an object is deleted from AD, the object remains for a set period of time known as the Tombstone Lifetime, and the isDeleted attribute is set to TRUE. Once an object exceeds the Tombstone Lifetime, it will be entirely removed. Microsoft recommends a tombstone lifetime of 180 days to increase the usefulness of backups, but this value may differ across environments. Depending on the DC operating system version, this value will default to 60 or 180 days. If an object is deleted in a domain that does not have an AD Recycle Bin, it will become a tombstone object. When this happens, the object is stripped of most of its attributes and placed in the Deleted Objects container for the duration of the tombstoneLifetime. It can be recovered, but any attributes that were lost can no longer be recovered.

AD Recycle Bin
The AD Recycle Bin was first introduced in Windows Server 2008 R2 to facilitate the recovery of deleted AD objects. This made it easier for sysadmins to restore objects, avoiding the need to restore from backups, restarting Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), or rebooting a Domain Controller. When the AD Recycle Bin is enabled, any deleted objects are preserved for a period of time, facilitating restoration if needed. Sysadmins can set how long an object remains in a deleted, recoverable state. If this is not specified, the object will be restorable for a default value of 60 days. The biggest advantage of using the AD Recycle Bin is that most of a deleted object's attributes are preserved, which makes it far easier to fully restore a deleted object to its previous state.

SYSVOL
The SYSVOL folder, or share, stores copies of public files in the domain such as system policies, Group Policy settings, logon/logoff scripts, and often contains other types of scripts that are executed to perform various tasks in the AD environment. The contents of the SYSVOL folder are replicated to all DCs within the environment using File Replication Services (FRS). You can read more about the SYSVOL structure here.

AdminSDHolder
The AdminSDHolder object is used to manage ACLs for members of built-in groups in AD marked as privileged. It acts as a container that holds the Security Descriptor applied to members of protected groups. The SDProp (SD Propagator) process runs on a schedule on the PDC Emulator Domain Controller. When this process runs, it checks members of protected groups to ensure that the correct ACL is applied to them. It runs every hour by default. For example, suppose an attacker is able to create a malicious ACL entry to grant a user certain rights over a member of the Domain Admins group. In that case, unless they modify other settings in AD, these rights will be removed (and they will lose any persistence they were hoping to achieve) when the SDProp process runs on the set interval.

dsHeuristics
The dsHeuristics attribute is a string value set on the Directory Service object used to define multiple forest-wide configuration settings. One of these settings is to exclude built-in groups from the Protected Groups list. Groups in this list are protected from modification via the AdminSDHolder object. If a group is excluded via the dsHeuristics attribute, then any changes that affect it will not be reverted when the SDProp process runs.

adminCount
The adminCount attribute determines whether or not the SDProp process protects a user. If the value is set to 0 or not specified, the user is not protected. If the attribute value is set to 1, the user is protected. Attackers will often look for accounts with the adminCount attribute set to 1 to target in an internal environment. These are often privileged accounts and may lead to further access or full domain compromise.

Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)
ADUC is a GUI console commonly used for managing users, groups, computers, and contacts in AD. Changes made in ADUC can be done via PowerShell as well.

ADSI Edit
ADSI Edit is a GUI tool used to manage objects in AD. It provides access to far more than is available in ADUC and can be used to set or delete any attribute available on an object, add, remove, and move objects as well. It is a powerful tool that allows a user to access AD at a much deeper level. Great care should be taken when using this tool, as changes here could cause major problems in AD.

sIDHistory
This attribute holds any SIDs that an object was assigned previously. It is usually used in migrations so a user can maintain the same level of access when migrated from one domain to another. This attribute can potentially be abused if set insecurely, allowing an attacker to gain prior elevated access that an account had before a migration if SID Filtering (or removing SIDs from another domain from a user's access token that could be used for elevated access) is not enabled.

NTDS.DIT
The NTDS.DIT file can be considered the heart of Active Directory. It is stored on a Domain Controller at C:\Windows\NTDS\ and is a database that stores AD data such as information about user and group objects, group membership, and, most important to attackers and penetration testers, the password hashes for all users in the domain. Once full domain compromise is reached, an attacker can retrieve this file, extract the hashes, and either use them to perform a pass-the-hash attack or crack them offline using a tool such as Hashcat to access additional resources in the domain. If the setting Store password with reversible encryption is enabled, then the NTDS.DIT will also store the cleartext passwords for all users created or who changed their password after this policy was set. While rare, some organizations may enable this setting if they use applications or protocols that need to use a user's existing password (and not Kerberos) for authentication.

MSBROWSE
MSBROWSE is a Microsoft networking protocol that was used in early versions of Windows-based local area networks (LANs) to provide browsing services. It was used to maintain a list of resources, such as shared printers and files, that were available on the network, and to allow users to easily browse and access these resources.

In older version of Windows we could use nbtstat -A ip-address to search for the Master Browser. If we see MSBROWSE it means that's the Master Browser. Additionally, we could use nltest utility to query a Windows Master Browser for the names of the Domain Controllers.

Today, MSBROWSE is largely obsolete and is no longer in widespread use. Modern Windows-based LANs use the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol for file and printer sharing, and the Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol for browsing services.
