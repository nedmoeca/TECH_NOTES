## 1. Reconnaissance & Discovery
### 1.1 Connect to Hack The Box

First, download your personalized `.ovpn` file from Hack The Box.

Connect to the HTB VPN using the `.ovpn` configuration file. This establishes a secure tunnel that allows access to the target machine’s internal network.

Command: `sudo openvpn your_file.ovpn`

Start the Machine.

### 1.2 Store the target address in a shell variable

**Command:**

```bash
IP=TARGET_IP
echo $IP
```

To clear the variable:

```bash
unset IP
```

### 1.3 Verify Target is Reachable

Verify that the target machine is up and reachable by performing an ICMP ping test.

**Command:** `ping -c 4 TARGET_IP`

**Breakdown:**

- `-c 4` → sends 4 packets only (clean output, fast)

**Result:**

```shell

```

A successful response confirms that the machine is active and accessible on the HTB network, allowing us to proceed with the enumeration phase.

### 1.4 Port Scan with Nmap

Before we can attack a system, we need to find out what "doors" are open. Doors in this context are ports. We use a tool called **Nmap** (Network Mapper) to scan the target's IP address and see what services are running.

#### 1.4.1 Full Port Sweep

Begin enumeration by discovering every open port on the target. Run a fast scan across all 65,535 ports to build a complete picture of the attack surface before committing to deeper inspection.

Begin enumeration by discovering every open port on the target. Run a fast scan across all 65,535 ports to build a complete picture of the attack surface before committing to deeper inspection.

**Command:** `nmap -p- --min-rate 5000 -Pn TARGET_IP | grapo`

**Breakdown:**

| Component         | Purpose             | Simple Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `nmap`            | Port scanner        | Sends packets to each port and classifies the response as open, closed, or filtered.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `-p-`             | Port range          | Shorthand for ports 1–65535. Without it nmap checks only its built-in list of 1000 common ports.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `--min-rate 5000` | Timing floor        | Forces at least 5000 packets per second instead of letting nmap's adaptive timing throttle down. This is what makes a full-range scan finish in seconds rather than minutes. Note the **double** dash.                                             |
| `-Pn`             | Skip host discovery | Treats the host as up without pinging first. HTB machines commonly drop ICMP; without this, nmap may conclude the host is down and scan nothing.                                                                                                   |
| `\| grapo`        | Custom filter       | Local zsh function: `tee /dev/tty \| grep -oP '^\d+(?=/tcp\s+open)' \| paste -sd, \| sed 's/^/\n/'`. Prints the full nmap output to the terminal while extracting open port numbers into a comma-separated list ready to paste into the next scan. |

**Result:**

```shell

```

#### 1.4.2 The "Deep Dive" Scan (Targeted Aggression)

**Command:** `nmap -A -p p1,p2,p3,p4 TARGET_IP`

**Breakdown:**

- **`-A`**
    - **Description:** Aggressive Scan Mode.
    - **Purpose:** Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning (`-sC`), and traceroute all at once.
- `-p`
    - **Description:** Targeted Port List.
    - **Purpose:** Restricts the heavy scanning to only the ports you confirmed are open, saving significant time and processing power.

```shell

## **Key Highlights**

- You start with network scanning on a Linux machine and identify three open services on the target ip.
- The web enumeration task on the HTTP page reveals a useful URL pattern after using the third option.
- Improper controls expose another user id record, leading to a downloadable pcap file.
- Wireshark analysis uncovers plaintext credentials that help you gain an SSH foothold.
- Privilege escalation comes from an exposed Python binary with special capabilities.
- The box builds practical skills and ends with the root flag, almost like a refreshing slice of cold watermelon.

## **Introduction**

HackTheBox machines are a great way to build practical skills without getting lost in theory. In this guide, you will walk through the Layover challenge in a simple, beginner-friendly way using only the provided steps. The machine teaches you how a small vulnerability can grow into full system access when enumeration is done well. If you want a clean path from open ports to user access and finally root, this walkthrough gives you a solid starting point.

Layover Hack The Box

**READ NEXT: [Touch Walkthrough: Beginner’s Writeup from Hack The Box](https://thecybersecguru.com/ctf-walkthroughs/mastering-touch-beginners-writeup-from-hackthebox/)**

## **Understanding the Layover Hack The Box Challenge**

At a high level, this HackTheBox challenge is a Linux target that rewards careful observation. Your first steps involve basic service checks, then a web enumeration task on the HTTP page. From there, a predictable URL structure, which may lead to an insecure direct object reference, becomes important.

What follows is a clear chain of exploitation. You move from the web app to a packet capture, then to credentials, then to shell access, and finally into a privileged directory. The next sections break that flow into simple, manageable stages. Provided credentials: **contractor** / **Contractor2026!**

## **Initial Foothold**

### 1. The Scan

```shell
nmap -sC -sV -p- 10.10.11.XX
```

### 2. The Result

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE       VERSION22/tcp   open  ssh           OpenSSH 9.6p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu13.19 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)| ssh-hostkey: |   256  (ECDSA)|_  256 (ED25519)3389/tcp open  ms-wbt-server Microsoft Terminal Service
```

### 3. Next Steps (Using Provided Credentials)

You only have two ports and a set of provided credentials (`contractor` / `Contractor2026!`).

**Attempt SSH:**

```shell
ssh contractor@10.10.11.XX
```

_(Result: Connection fails or is restricted. SSH is a dead end here.)_

**Attempt RDP:**  
Since port 3389 is open on a Linux machine, it’s running `xrdp` (a graphical remote desktop). You can connect using a GUI tool like Remmina, or via the command line:

```shell
xfreerdp /v:10.10.11.XX /u:contractor /p:'Contractor2026!' /cert:ignore /dynamic-resolution
```

### The Foothold

The RDP session connects successfully. You are now looking at the graphical Linux desktop environment (Xfce) as the user `contractor`.

_(End of initial foothold. You are now inside the machine’s GUI and ready to begin enumeration.)_
